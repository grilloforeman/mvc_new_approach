# mvc_new_approach
A new approach to thinking about the use of MVC and its use....




**The idea of â€‹â€‹using mvc with struct and where to apply it**, with copilot several questions were asked
and the applicability of this way of using mvc with structs, you have to take into account that 
there are different scenarios and programming languages, for example php where it uses http, 
where nowadays with poo, that is, after downloading everything, the struct with procedural 
perhaps depending on the form of the code can have a good performance depending on the scenario











another using mvc with structs in some high-level language like php that works on the server side, 
thinking beyond and even the difference between well that loads everything into memory and using procedural
with strutcs would have any advantage because php works with http and after access it unloads the object 
from memory in which scenario could this have any advantage? game, where even if you download perhaps a 
code that has several classes, methods and variables, a procedural with struct and using access to the 
database with basic information from a web game against other users where it has, in the example, 
values â€‹â€‹from previous games and against other players


Using a procedural approach with structs instead of OOP can have some advantages in certain scenarios, 
especially when it comes to memory and performance management. 
Let's explore this in detail, considering the context of a PHP web game.

### Advantages of Using Procedural with Structs in PHP
#### Memory Management:

PHP is a scripting language that works with the HTTP request-response cycle. 
This means that objects are typically loaded into memory only during the execution of a request and are then discarded.

Using a procedural approach with structs (or associative arrays, in the case of PHP) can be lighter in terms of memory, 
as it avoids the overhead associated with creating and managing objects.

### Performance:

Creating and destroying objects can have higher overhead compared to simple data structures. In a web gaming scenario where multiple 
requests are constantly made, reducing this overhead can result in performance improvements.

Simple operations on arrays or structs tend to be faster than method calls on objects, especially in high-load situations.

### Simplicity:

The procedural approach can be simpler and more straightforward, especially for developers who are not familiar with OOP. 
This can make code easier to maintain and reduce complexity, as long as the project doesn't become too large.


### Scenario: Web Game with Database Access
Imagine a web game where players compete against each other and information about previous games and scores is stored in a database.
You can structure your code using a procedural approach with structs to manage this information.

## Example:

## Model (Model):


``` function getPlayerScores($playerId) {
    // Suponha que vocÃª tenha uma conexÃ£o com o banco de dados chamada $conn
    $query = "SELECT score FROM scores WHERE player_id = ?";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $playerId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $scores = [];
    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        $scores[] = $row['score'];
    }
    return $scores;
}
```

### VisÃ£o (View):

```function displayScores($scores) {
    foreach ($scores as $score) {
        echo "PontuaÃ§Ã£o: " . htmlspecialchars($score) . "<br>";
    }
} 
```



### Controlador (Controller):
```
function handleRequest($playerId) {
    $scores = getPlayerScores($playerId);
    displayScores($scores);
}




```
### Arquivo Principal:
```
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'GET' && isset($_GET['player_id'])) {
    $playerId = intval($_GET['player_id']);
    handleRequest($playerId);
}
```
### Conclusion
In a scenario like a web game, where performance and memory management are crucial, using a procedural approach with structs can offer significant advantages. However, it's important to carefully evaluate your project's specific needs and consider the trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility.
