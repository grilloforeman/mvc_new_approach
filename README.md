# mvc_new_approach
A new approach to thinking about the use of MVC and its use....




** The idea of ​​using mvc with struct and where to apply it**, with copilot several questions were asked
and the applicability of this way of using mvc with structs, you have to take into account that 
there are different scenarios and programming languages, for example php where it uses http, 
where nowadays with poo, that is, after downloading everything, the struct with procedural 
perhaps depending on the form of the code can have a good performance depending on the scenario











another using mvc with structs in some high-level language like php that works on the server side, 
thinking beyond and even the difference between well that loads everything into memory and using procedural
with strutcs would have any advantage because php works with http and after access it unloads the object 
from memory in which scenario could this have any advantage? game, where even if you download perhaps a 
code that has several classes, methods and variables, a procedural with struct and using access to the 
database with basic information from a web game against other users where it has, in the example, 
values ​​from previous games and against other players
