Sure! Here is the translation of the provided text:

It is not exactly a new architecture, but rather a way to apply a known design pattern (MVC) in a language that does not have native support for OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). 
By using structs and functions in C, you are adapting the MVC pattern to work within the limitations and characteristics of the C language.

This approach is useful because it allows you to keep your code organized, modular, and easier to maintain, even in a low-level language like C. However, 
the separation of concerns and modularity that the MVC pattern offers are concepts applicable to many languages and contexts, regardless of whether they are high or low-level languages.

In summary, using structs in C to implement the MVC pattern is an adaptation of an already existing and widely used concept in other languages, 
and not a new architecture in itself. If you need more information or have other questions, I am here to help! ðŸ˜Š
